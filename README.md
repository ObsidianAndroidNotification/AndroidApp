# ObsidianAndroidNotifications
This application provides a solution to receive native android os notification from your obisidan notes!

- Configure drive sync:
  - enable autosync in global settings
  - sync method: two-way
  - uncheck 'exclude hidden files'
- Install ObisidianAndroidNotifications
- Configure ObisidianAndroidNotifications:
  - add your reminder plugin config file(YOUR_VAULT/.obisidan/plugins/obisidian-reminder-plugin/data.json)  as watched folder
- drink a beer! üç∫

### Tips
Please note that the foreground service is immutable, which means that the notification will remain visible even if you try to dismiss it.
But you can mute it, if you mute the `OBSIDIAN_TASK_FOREGROUND` category in the app's notification.
